# SpaceX_Capstone_Project_IBM
### Introduction
In this capstone project, the objective is to make predictions on the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX offers rocket launches on their website, priced at 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers whose costs can reach 165 million dollars per launch, mainly due to the reusability of the first stage. By accurately determining the landing outcome, we can estimate the cost of a launch, which can be valuable information for competing companies interested in bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
